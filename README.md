# Download_emails.py

It is a small script that access your Outlook MS email and download the data that it contains:
- Name of Sender
- Email of Sender
- Time and date of email
- Attachments
- Body
- Type of email based on VBA classes

  Later it summarizes it in pandas dataframe to have programmatic access and analysis capabilities.

  Note: It does not extract .msg file. It simply dowloads the attachments in the body.

   Enjoy!
